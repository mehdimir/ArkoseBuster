# ArkoseBuster
<h3>Arkose Labs captcha solver written in Python using Selenium and using IBM Watson STT AI</h3><br>
Useful for any kinds of browser automation/botting that needs to get past a sneaky captcha. Ironic how a bot is able to crack Arkose Labs captchas, but for a human it's impossible. A real staple in shitty design.<br>
<i>This is not a standalone tool. You can run it to demonstrate how it works, but the purpose of this tool is for it to be integrated in other peoples' projects</i>
